# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
I am moderately comfortable with XD. I have used it to create a few prototypes and have been able to use it to create a few click-through designs. I have been using Figma most of the time, however, I'm sure I wouldn't have too much trouble using XD.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
My concern isn't with XD specifically, but with the process of creating the final design. It takes a lot of time to create a design and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it on time.

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
I am moderately comfortable with React. I use it often in my personal projects. However, I am not sure I have used PropTypes or ESLint in the past.

**What are your concerns around using React?**
My concern is with using React is learning how to use PropTypes and ESLint properly to complete the project and meet the requirements.

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
Redux is a fairly new technology that I have looked into but have not used before. So I am not comfortable with Redux yet.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
Redux seems pretty complex, so my concern is mainly the time and effort it may take to learn and use it properly.

## Node

You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**
Node is a technology that I have used quite a bit before. I've used it to create a few mock APIs and express servers. So I am pretty comfortable with Node.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
I don't have any concerns with using Node. I am sure I will be able to use it comfortably to complete the project.

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
Express is a technology that I have just started using recently. I am fairly comfortable using it to meet most of the requirements for the project.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
At the moment, I don't have any concerns about using Express. It seems to be fairly simple to use and any problems I may encounter will be resolved quickly.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
I have very little experience with Sequelize and relational databases. I have used it enough to know the basics of how to use it. However, I wouldn't say I am comfortable with them.

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
My primary concern is creating the migrations and seeds. It was briefly covered a bit in a previous project, so I will need to learn more about them and how they work.
