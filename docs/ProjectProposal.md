## Problem Statement

Candlemakers today are frustrated with the cost and complexity of inventory management software. They can be expensive and are often difficult to use. Many turn to free solutions like Google Sheets to keep track of inventory which isn't the most efficient way to manage inventory. To make inventory management easier for small candle makers, they need a simple and easy-to-use solution that takes out the guesswork and allows them to focus on making candles.

## Pain Points

One pain point for small candle makers is that they have to manually calculate the amount of materials needed to make a candle. This is a time-consuming process and requires a lot of manual work. 

## Solution Statement

The solution is to build a simple inventory management system that caters to the needs of small candle makers. From tracking raw materials, calculating the cost of goods, candle formulas, and tracking production and sales made. What makes this solution different from other inventory management systems is that it does formula calculations automatically and allows the candle maker to focus on making candles.

## Competition

Some of the competitors are Crafty Base and Zoho. Crafty Base is an inventory management and finance software designed especially for handmade craft sellers. The software seems to have a heavy focus on the financial aspect of the business. While it does offer automated inventory management, it isn't the most intuitive and is a little more complicated than the solution we are proposing. Zoho is a cloud-based inventory management software that is easy to use and has a lot of features but focuses more on sale management than inventory and production management.

## Key Features

The key features of Inventera are:

* Automated inventory management - Automatically calculates the amount of materials in stock and the cost of materials. Updates inventory and cost of goods automatically. 
* Formula calculations - Automatically calculates the amount of materials needed to make a candle. For example, if the candle requires 12% fragrance for an 8oz candle, the formula will automatically calculate the amount of fragrance and wax needed to make an 8oz candle.
* Cost of goods - Automatically calculates the cost of goods.
* Unit of Measure - Allows the candle maker to choose the unit of measure for the candle.
* Production and Sales - Allows the candle maker to track the production and sales of candles.
