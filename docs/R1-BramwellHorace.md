## How to Find and Target Your Social Media Audience

This article gives a very in-depth overview of how to develop a clear and effective strategy to find and target your social media audience. This is helpful as someone who doesn't use social media, so this article was an informative read. Some of the key concepts include:

- **Using social listening** - Monitoring hashtags and keywords that your audience is using to talk about your brand or your competitors is a great way to target your audience. When I am ready to launch a product or service, I will use this information to help make informed decisions to best target my audience.
- **Checking out the competition** - I learned that social media audiences often overlap, so checking out your competitors can help you identify key lessons learned or even help you identify a new segment that you've may have not considered.
- **Understanding what your target audience wants from your social channels** - This section in the articles offered some great questions to consider when thinking about your product or service. Having a strong understanding of what your product offers your audience is a great way to know if you are meeting their needs. For example, what are the benefits? Does your product make their lives easier? Does it solve a specific problem?

## What Is a Wireframe? 7 Reasons Why Wireframing Is Important In Web Design

This article discusses the importance of wireframing and how to use wireframes to help you create a design that is easy to understand and easy to implement. Some of the key concepts include:

- **How wireframes address scalability and ease-of-update** - I learned that wireframes do much more than just help you visualize your design. They also help you identify how well your design will scale over time. Wireframes can help to ensure that your design is flexible and easy to update.
- **Why you shouldn't skip wireframes** - As much as I am not a fan of wireframing and think that they take me too much time to create, I learned that wireframes help you save time in the long run. For example, your designs are more calculated and help you understand what you are trying to build more efficiently.
- **How wireframes help the client** - Wireframes not only help you as a developer to understand what you are building, but they also help your client. Clients often want to know what they are getting, so wireframes allow them to know what to expect and allow them to respond to elements of the design early on.
